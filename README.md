# Introduction to Robotics (2023 - 2024)

🤖🥁 Welcome to my exploration journey in robotics 🥁🤖

What you can find here:

📋 Homework Assignments 🖋: This repository will host a series of laboratory assignments received during the 3rd year at the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science, University of Bucharest. Each assignment will include the following features:

* Requirements: Detailed instructions on what is expected for each assignment.
* Files: Naming must respect the standard in the requirements.
* Implementation Details (if applicable): Specifics about how the assignment was implemented.
* Picture of the Setup: Visual representations of the project setup.
* Video: Demonstrations or descriptions (or more/less :) ) of the completed assignment.

🥳 Welcome once again, and let's have fun exploring together! 🥳

P.S. I'm happy to receive feedback or advice. 😁

  <summary><h2>Homework 1: Controlling an RGB LED using individual potentiometers. </h2></summary>
  <strong>Technical Task:</strong> Use a separate potentiometer for controlling each color of the RGB LED:Red, Green, and Blue. This control must leverage digital electronics. Specifically, you need to read the potentiometer’s value with Arduino and then write a mapped value to the LED pins.  <br>
  
  <strong>Components:</strong>
  * RGB LED (At least 1)
  * Potentiometers (At least 3)
  * Resistors and wires as needed
